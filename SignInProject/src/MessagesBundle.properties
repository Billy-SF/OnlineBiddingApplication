faq1 = Frequently Asked Questions ABOUT SELLING AT OttawAuction
faq2 = How much does it cost to sell at OttawAuction?
faq3 = A consignment is a group or lot of items entrusted to Hands Auction to be auctioned. Hands Auction collects a commission from the seller (this can be discussed when you call to reserve your space at the auction sale). There are no other charges unless pickup services have been acquired.
faq4 = To sell estates and/or on-site auctions, Hands Auction first does a complimentary visit to determine commission rate. (this will be discussed with you at that time). In addition, certain expenses which are to be paid by the seller will be discussed and approved. These expenses will be deducted from the sale proceeds. For example, these expenses could include advertising, clerk and cashier.
faq5 = How much is the seller\u2019s commission?
faq6 = Hands Auction\u2019s standard commission rate on consignment auctions is 30% of the hammer price. However, on-site auctions vary depending upon the merchandise (could be 15%, 5% and/or 3%).
faq7 = How do I get an appraisal?
faq8 = Formal written appraisals (usually for a fee) are not necessary to determine a pre-sale auction estimate. If you are interested in selling something by auction, Hands Auction is pleased to do a complimentary pre-sale visit. For other purposes, a formal written appraisal can be provided for either fair market or insurance values. Fair market value represents what we believe an item would bring at auction. Insurance values reflect what we believe it would cost to replace an item. For more information on our Qualified Appraisal services Contact us through email or phone our main office (613) 267-6027 or 267-1331.
faq9 = How do I consign an item for auction?
faq10 = If you are interested in selling items through Hands Auction, our staff can help you with every aspect of the process. You will need to deliver your items to Hands Auction Hall or one of our selected auction sites, or, arrange for pickup through our office. We will then disclose the auction date, time and location. Consignment results and cheques are processed and issued within 2 days of the auction. On-site auction results and cheque are issued within 1 hour after the auction.
faq11 = Frequently asked Questions ABOUT PRE-AUCTION
faq12 = How can I get information on upcoming auctions?
faq13 = Full listings of our auctions appear in local papers, specific to the auction location, under the auction section. You will find the real estate auctions that we conduct advertised under the auction section rather than the real estate section. Always remember to view our web site for upcoming auctions. We are also just a phone call away.
faq14 = Can I see the pieces before the auction?
faq15 = We recommend that you do. Depending on the auction and its location, Hands Auction exhibits items one day prior to sale date. Other auctions can be previewed two hours prior to auction time. The preview gives you an opportunity to see the pieces first hand and evaluate the condition for yourself or with the assistance of the auctioneer or any other specialist. Staff is available to help remove a piece from its container for closer inspection.
faq16 = Is there an admission fee?
faq17 = There is no charge to attend a preview or an auction.
faq18 = Are there any Terms or Conditions at our auction?
faq19 = The Terms and Conditions at Hands Auction are \u201Cthe best in the world, cash or cheque\u201D. If the auctioneer sells the item to be good check it over as soon as you buy it. If it is damaged, please return the item before four more articles have been sold and you will not be charged. The same article will be put back up for auction. As soon as you become the owner of any article you are responsible for it whether it becomes lost, stolen, or broken you pay for it just the same. All furniture, appliances and grab lots are sold as-is, however we do tell you exactly what we know about the article. All sales are final. In the case of an argument or dispute, the auctioneer shall settle it in his/her own manner. The auctioneer acts only as an agent.
faq20 = Frequently Asked Questions ABOUT AUCTION PROCEDURES
faq21 = Do you have to register to attend an auction?
faq22 = Seats are not reserved but are available on a first-come basis. We often suggest that you bring a lawnchair to on-site auctions. If you are intending to bid, you will have to register with the cashier, giving your name, address and phone number. You will then be handed a buyer\u2019s number. There is no cost to getting a buyer\u2019s number.
faq23 = Do I need identification?
faq24 = In order to register for the first time, you will be asked for your name, address, phone number and driver\u2019s licence, which will be entered into our computerized database. Please note that our auctions are fully computerized. To attend future auctions, once registered, you will be asked for your phone number only.
faq25 = How do I bid?
faq26 = Bidding at Hands Auction is very straight forward. Once an item is held up, all you have to do is raise your buyer\u2019s number. You may raise your hand if you wish. The auctioneer may also become aware of your specific bidding technique such as the raise of an eyebrow or the flip of a finger. Do not feel that you have to sit on your hands. Scratching your nose or pulling your ear will only be taken as a bid if this is your mannerism. If no one tops your bid, the auctioneer will close the sale of that particular item. You may at this time hold onto your items at your seat, or, take them to your vehicle, returning to the hall to either make payment or enjoy the remainder of the auction. When you have completed making your purchases you must go to the cashier desk and make payment. Please note that the final purchase price is determined by adding Pst and Gst where applicable. A Buyer\u2019s Premium is added if we are auctioning Real Estate.
faq27 = Where does the bidding start?
faq28 = The bidding starts the minute a person in the crowd raises their bidding card or announces so.
faq29 = What is a Reserve Bid?
faq30 = A reserve bid is the minimum price agreed upon by the Seller (usually real estate). At Hands Auction, the auctioneer will announce if there is a \u201Cconfidential\u201D reserve bid. If the reserve bid is met then the real estate is sold. If the bidding reaches close to the reserve bid, the seller, auctioneer and bidder may have a brief recess to discuss the potential sale. If no price has been agreed upon the property is returned to the owner. Reserve bids are rare to none at outdoor & in-hall auction sales.
faq31 = How does one make an Absentee or Advance Bid?
faq32 = For those who cannot attend the auction, but previewed the items, pre-registration must be done. A buyer\u2019s number will then be issued to the client and returned to the cashier with the lot number, item description and dollar amount that the client will go. Note: Hands Auction will try to buy the items for you at the lowest possible price (and never exceeding your bid). There is no charge for placing an advance bid. If your bid is successful we will phone you, detailing purchase price and pick up arrangements.
faq33 = Remember: the advance bid you make only indicates the upper limit which you are prepared to pay. If you are not outbid on the price, chances are you may purchase the item for less than your actual advance bid.
faq34 = Frequently Asked Questions POST AUCTION
faq35 = What is a Buyer\u2019s Premium?
faq36 = A buyer\u2019s premium is a commission charged to the purchaser on the hammer price of the item purchased. The buyer\u2019s premium is charged to cover pertinent expenses whether it be advertising &/or the auctioneer\u2019s commission. Hands Auction uses a buyer\u2019s premium only on certain pieces of real estate. We have never to-date used a buyer\u2019s premium on any other item.
faq37 = Do I have to pay taxes?
faq38 = Provincial and Goods & Services Taxes are applicable in all cases. Exemption only applies if you have proof of a valid \u201CFarm Use\u201D licence or \u201CDealer\u2019s licence\u201D.
faq39 = If I am a dealer, how do I register my resale number?
faq40 = An Ontario Retail Sales Tax Purchase Exemption Certificate must be filled out and submitted to our cashier\u2019s department or filled out at the aucton site.
faq41 = How soon do I have to pay for my purchases?
faq42 = Payment is due immediately following the auction or when you are ready to leave the auction.
faq43 = Does Hands Auction take credit cards or any other payment?
faq44 = Hands Auction does not accept credit cards. We accept personal cheques and cash only.
faq45 = When can one pick up there purchases?
faq46 = You can take your purchases straight home with you from the auction as long as we have received payment in full. A receipt will be issued to you.
faq47 = Do you charge for storage?
faq48 = All purchases should be picked up day of auction. If you need more time to make arrangements, please discuss the matter with the auctioneer.
