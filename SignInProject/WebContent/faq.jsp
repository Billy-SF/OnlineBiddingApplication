								<h3>
									Frequently Asked Questions <strong>ABOUT OttawAuction</strong>
								</h3>
								<p>
									<strong>Where are we located?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Our home and auction hall are located 3 miles east of
									Perth, Ontario on County Road # 10, also known as the Franktown
									Road. Our mailing address is R.R.# 1 Perth, Ontario K7H 3C3 .
									Phone numbers (613) 267-6027 (Jim &amp; Judy) and (613)
									267-1335 (Trevor). Fax (613) 267-6931.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What are our hours?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Office hours are from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through
									Sunday, year round.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Who are the people in charge?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Jim, Judy and Trevor Hands are the Qualified Auctioneers.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What do we auction?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Hands Auction is noted for auctioning estates,
									collectibles and real estate, but, other items passing through
									our sales rooms are new and used furniture, vehicles, sporting
									goods, commercial lots, jewellery, tools of the trade,
									bankruptcies, liquidations, farm machinery and livestock sales,
									paintings and specialty sales including charity auctions.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Is buying at Hands Auction very expensive?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Not necessarily. Many people are surprised to learn that
									buying at auction can be less expensive than buying retail and
									that one can buy an authentic antique at Hands Auction for less
									than the price of a modern reproduction.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>How do I know what I am buying is authentic?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>We use our Knowledge and best judgement to determine
									authenticity. However, as is widely known, determining
									authenticity is not an exact science, but a matter of opinion.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3>
									Frequently Asked Questions <strong>ABOUT SELLING AT
										OttawAuction</strong>
								</h3>
								<p>
									<strong>How much does it cost to sell at OttawAuction?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>A consignment is a group or lot of items entrusted to
									Hands Auction to be auctioned. Hands Auction collects a
									commission from the seller (this can be discussed when you call
									to reserve your space at the auction sale). There are no other
									charges unless pickup services have been acquired.</p>
								<p>To sell estates and/or on-site auctions, Hands Auction
									first does a complimentary visit to determine commission rate.
									(this will be discussed with you at that time). In addition,
									certain expenses which are to be paid by the seller will be
									discussed and approved. These expenses will be deducted from
									the sale proceeds. For example, these expenses could include
									advertising, clerk and cashier.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>How much is the seller&#8217;s commission?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Hands Auction&#8217;s standard commission rate on consignment
									auctions is 30% of the hammer price. However, <strong>on-site</strong>
									auctions vary depending upon the merchandise (could be 15%, 5%
									and/or 3%).
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>How do I get an appraisal?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Formal written appraisals (usually for a fee) are not necessary
									to determine a pre-sale auction estimate. If you are interested
									in selling something by auction, Hands Auction is pleased to do
									a complimentary pre-sale visit. For other purposes, a formal
									written appraisal can be provided for either fair market or
									insurance values. Fair market value represents what we believe
									an item would bring at auction. Insurance values reflect what
									we believe it would cost to replace an item. For more
									information on our Qualified Appraisal services <a
										href="mailto:info@jimhandsauction.com">Contact us</a> through
									email or phone our main office (613) 267-6027 or 267-1331.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>How do I consign an item for auction?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									If you are interested in selling items through Hands Auction,
									our staff can help you with every aspect of the process. You
									will need to deliver your items to Hands Auction Hall or one of
									our selected auction sites, or, arrange for pickup through our
									office. We will then disclose the auction date, time and
									location. Consignment results and <strong>cheques are
										processed and issued within 2 days of the auction</strong>. On-site
									auction results and <strong>cheque are issued within 1
										hour after the auction.</strong>
								</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3>
									Frequently asked Questions <strong>ABOUT PRE-AUCTION</strong>
								</h3>
								<p>
									<strong>How can I get information on upcoming
										auctions?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Full listings of our auctions appear in local papers,
									specific to the auction location, under the auction section.
									You will find the real estate auctions that we conduct
									advertised under the auction section rather than the real
									estate section. Always remember to view our web site for
									upcoming auctions. We are also just a phone call away.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Can I see the pieces before the auction?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>We recommend that you do. Depending on the auction and
									its location, Hands Auction exhibits items one day prior to
									sale date. Other auctions can be previewed two hours prior to
									auction time. The preview gives you an opportunity to see the
									pieces first hand and evaluate the condition for yourself or
									with the assistance of the auctioneer or any other specialist.
									Staff is available to help remove a piece from its container
									for closer inspection.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Is there an admission fee?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>There is no charge to attend a preview or an auction.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Are there any Terms or Conditions at our
										auction?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>The Terms and Conditions at Hands Auction are &#8220;the
									best in the world, cash or cheque&#8221;. If the auctioneer
									sells the item to be good check it over as soon as you buy it.
									If it is damaged, please return the item before four more
									articles have been sold and you will not be charged. The same
									article will be put back up for auction. As soon as you become
									the owner of any article you are responsible for it whether it
									becomes lost, stolen, or broken you pay for it just the same.
									All furniture, appliances and grab lots are sold as-is, however
									we do tell you exactly what we know about the article. All
									sales are final. In the case of an argument or dispute, the
									auctioneer shall settle it in his/her own manner. The
									auctioneer acts only as an agent.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3>
									Frequently Asked Questions <strong>ABOUT AUCTION
										PROCEDURES</strong>
								</h3>
								<p>
									<strong>Do you have to register to attend an auction?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Seats are not reserved but are available on a first-come
									basis. We often suggest that you bring a lawnchair to on-site
									auctions. If you are intending to bid, you will have to
									register with the cashier, giving your name, address and phone
									number. You will then be handed a buyer&#8217;s number. There
									is no cost to getting a buyer&#8217;s number.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Do I need identification?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>In order to register for the first time, you will be
									asked for your name, address, phone number and driver&#8217;s
									licence, which will be entered into our computerized database.
									Please note that our auctions are fully computerized. To attend
									future auctions, once registered, you will be asked for your
									phone number only.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>How do I bid?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Bidding at Hands Auction is very straight forward. Once
									an item is held up, all you have to do is raise your
									buyer&#8217;s number. You may raise your hand if you wish. The
									auctioneer may also become aware of your specific bidding
									technique such as the raise of an eyebrow or the flip of a
									finger. Do not feel that you have to sit on your hands.
									Scratching your nose or pulling your ear will only be taken as
									a bid if this is your mannerism. If no one tops your bid, the
									auctioneer will close the sale of that particular item. You may
									at this time hold onto your items at your seat, or, take them
									to your vehicle, returning to the hall to either make payment
									or enjoy the remainder of the auction. When you have completed
									making your purchases you must go to the cashier desk and make
									payment. Please note that the final purchase price is
									determined by adding Pst and Gst where applicable. A
									Buyer&#8217;s Premium is added if we are auctioning Real
									Estate.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Where does the bidding start?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>The bidding starts the minute a person in the crowd
									raises their bidding card or announces so.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What is a Reserve Bid?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>A reserve bid is the minimum price agreed upon by the
									Seller (usually real estate). At Hands Auction, the auctioneer
									will announce if there is a &#8220;confidential&#8221; reserve
									bid. If the reserve bid is met then the real estate is sold. If
									the bidding reaches close to the reserve bid, the seller,
									auctioneer and bidder may have a brief recess to discuss the
									potential sale. If no price has been agreed upon the property
									is returned to the owner. Reserve bids are rare to none at
									outdoor &amp; in-hall auction sales.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>How does one make an Absentee or Advance Bid?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>For those who cannot attend the auction, but previewed
									the items, pre-registration must be done. A buyer&#8217;s
									number will then be issued to the client and returned to the
									cashier with the lot number, item description and dollar amount
									that the client will go. Note: Hands Auction will try to buy
									the items for you at the lowest possible price (and never
									exceeding your bid). There is no charge for placing an advance
									bid. If your bid is successful we will phone you, detailing
									purchase price and pick up arrangements.</p>
								<p>Remember: the advance bid you make only indicates the
									upper limit which you are prepared to pay. If you are not
									outbid on the price, chances are you may purchase the item for
									less than your actual advance bid.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3>
									Frequently Asked Questions <strong>POST AUCTION</strong>
								</h3>
								<p>
									<strong>What is a Buyer&#8217;s Premium?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>A buyer&#8217;s premium is a commission charged to the
									purchaser on the hammer price of the item purchased. The
									buyer&#8217;s premium is charged to cover pertinent expenses
									whether it be advertising &amp;/or the auctioneer&#8217;s
									commission. Hands Auction uses a buyer&#8217;s premium only on
									certain pieces of real estate. We have never to-date used a
									buyer&#8217;s premium on any other item.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Do I have to pay taxes?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Provincial and Goods &amp; Services Taxes are applicable
									in all cases. Exemption only applies if you have proof of a
									valid &#8220;Farm Use&#8221; licence or &#8220;Dealer&#8217;s
									licence&#8221;.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>If I am a dealer, how do I register my resale
										number?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>An Ontario Retail Sales Tax Purchase Exemption
									Certificate must be filled out and submitted to our
									cashier&#8217;s department or filled out at the aucton site.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>How soon do I have to pay for my purchases?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Payment is due immediately following the auction or when
									you are ready to leave the auction.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Does Hands Auction take credit cards or any
										other payment?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Hands Auction does not accept credit cards. We accept
									personal cheques and cash only.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>When can one pick up there purchases?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>You can take your purchases straight home with you from
									the auction as long as we have received payment in full. A
									receipt will be issued to you.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Do you charge for storage?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>All purchases should be picked up day of auction. If you
									need more time to make arrangements, please discuss the matter
									with the auctioneer.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Can Hands Auction arrange for delivery?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Hands Auction can provide &#8220;Movers&#8221; names in
									order for you to arrange pick up and delivery of your items.</p>
